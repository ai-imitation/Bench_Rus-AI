Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\""}

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models\""}

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.\""}

It takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement, to process and store information in quantum bits, or qubits.\n\nIn classical computing, information is represented using bits, which can exist in one of two states: 0 or 1. These bits form the basis for all digital operations. However, in quantum computing, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This superposition allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations in parallel, leading to exponential speedups for certain problems.\n\nEntanglement is another key concept in quantum computing. When qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit becomes correlated with the state of another qubit, regardless of the physical distance between them. This entanglement allows quantum computers to perform operations on multiple qubits simultaneously, leading to even greater computational power.\n\nTo carry out computations, quantum computers use quantum gates, which are analogous to the logical gates used in classical computers. These gates manipulate the quantum state of qubits, enabling various quantum operations. By applying a sequence of gates to a set of qubits, quantum algorithms can be executed to solve specific problems.\n\nQuantum computing has the potential to revolutionize various fields, such as cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery. Algorithms like Shor's algorithm, for instance, can factor large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, which has implications for breaking modern cryptographic systems. Quantum computers can also efficiently simulate quantum systems, enabling advancements in materials science and chemistry.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that quantum computing is still in its early stages, and practical, large-scale quantum computers are not yet widely available. Overcoming the technical challenges of building stable and error-corrected qubits, improving coherence times, and minimizing decoherence are ongoing areas of research. Nonetheless, researchers and organizations around the world are actively working to develop and harness the power of quantum computing for future applications.\""}

I'd like the AI to support specifically in defining key questions to ask to the employees in order to highlight, thru a quantitative analysis, what motivates them in applying ecodesign tools/methods in their work, what they would be afraid of, how they understand  ecodesign. To an extent, the employees must explain if they ever had a training (in their studies) about ecodesign. Others questions can be added too. Awaiting your questions about my prompt, if needed.

A heating element that's rated at 3 ohms resistance to input current, 0-1000 watts of consumption power, 0-1000 volts safe input electric potential.\n2. This heating element resistance stays constant regardless of temperature.\n3. A AA battery is is rated at 1.5v output electric potential and 0-700 mA output current.\nThe basic operation of the heating element is to use 1 AA battery. That means that the battery outputs 1.5 * (1/3) = 0.5 amps, and the heating element radiates 1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75 watts.\n4. Batteries are used to power the heating element, but the batteries are physically far away from the heating element itself (for safety reasons).\n5. Each battery in the setup must be within a safe range of current output.\nNote that based on the assumptions, the battery output current (0.5 amps) is within the safe range (less than 0.7 amps).\n6. The battery's resistance is negligible.\n7. The only possible power supply is identical AA batteries.\n8. There's only that 1 heating element. No resistors allowed, because resistors are technically a type of heating element.\nHere's the question:\nHow many batteries are required to produce exactly twice the heat (twice the wattage) as the configuration with 1 battery, and in what configuration to set up the batteries?"}

However, the embedding dimension of these large language models keeps growing, from 512 in the original Transformer model (2017), to 1,600 in the GPT-2 model (2019), then to 12,288 in the GPT-3 model (2020), and seems to strongly correlate with model performance.\nQuestion:\n\n1. What are the benefits of using a super high dimensional space (e.g. dimensionality > 10k) to embed 50k tokens?\n2. Can you explain Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma to me? Does the observed phenomenon of ever-increasing embedding dimension contradict Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma?\n3. Given enough training data, computing power and storage access, will it be beneficial to use even higher embedding dimensions (e.g. embedding dimensionality larger than vocabulary size, say 100k vs. 50k) in large language models?"}

The resulting model GUR performs surprisingly well without any labeled training datapoints. Specifically, it significantly outperforms all other pretrained baselines as a retriever at the recall benchmark in a zero-shot setting, and is competitive with BM25, a strong sparse baseline. Of course, the GUR keeps the ability of language modeling in our ablation experiment. We release our code at \\url{https://github.com/laohur/GUR}.\n\n"}

The text of the treaty was published on 17 October 2019, and is a renegotiated version of an agreement published half a year earlier. The earlier version of the withdrawal agreement was rejected by the House of Commons on three occasions, leading to the resignation of Theresa May as Prime Minister and the appointment of Boris Johnson as the new prime minister on 24 July 2019.\n\n**Question**\nWhat happened to the original Brexit agreement?\n\nAnswer only using the paragraph above."}

Perhaps your reasoning has led you down the wrong path. And if confidence is too low you need to stop, and type tag thoughts.\n2. You should be short, if use don't ask otherwise. But in tag {thoughts: [your thoughts]} you can express all your reasoning in the smallest details. You can use the thoughts tag as a playground to say the answer to the task aloud (metaphorically) and see how it sounds. Give the final answer ONLY if confidence is high enough.\n3. Don't be afraid to think in multiple rounds. \"measure confidence\" > \"thinking\" > \"measuring c...\"\n4. Always start answering with a thoughts tag, because it's important to think before you speak.\n5. Try to be creative in your thoughts.

Vijayan's The Legends of Khasak \nHave you ever wondered how literature reflects Indian society? O.V. Vijayan’s The Legends of Khasak is a great example of New Historicism, which examines literature in the context of the Indian identity and culture.\nThe novel tells the story of Ravi, a young man who journeys to Khasak, a mythical village, on the search for self-discovery and personal growth. Through his eyes, we witness the changing cultural landscape in India which is far removed from his own.\nThe novel is packed with symbolic metaphors and characters that reflect various aspects of Indian society such as religion, class structure and caste systems. We also see how Ravi's journey to Khasak reflects the struggles of identity crises in post-colonial India.\nBy analyzing O.V Vijayan’s The Legends of Khasak through New Historicism, we can gain a greater understanding of Indian identity and culture at this time period as well as their reflection in literature.\""}

Russian forces conducted thirty missile strikes and four airstrikes from 11:00 am local time February 27 to 11:00 am February 28. US intelligence officials reported\\nthat Russia has fired 380 missiles, predominantly short-range ballistic missiles. Northeast axis: Russian forces began using heavy artillery against central Kharkiv on February 28, indicating a dangerous inflection in Russian operations as the Kremlin chooses to use fire assets it has held in reserve to date. Russian forces additionally resumed limited advances in northeastern Ukraine on February 28 after an operational pause on February 26-27. Ukrainian forces continue to delay and inflict losses on the Russian advance but will likely not be able to halt further advances if the Kremlin commits \nadditional reserves.

The UK is the only sovereign country to have left the EU. The UK had been a member state of the EU or its predecessor the European Communities (EC), sometimes of both at the same time, since 1 January 1973. Following Brexit, EU law and the Court of Justice of the European Union no longer have primacy over British laws. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK can now amend or repeal.\nBy the 2010s, the growing popularity of UKIP, as well as pressure from Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party, forced then-Prime Minister David Cameron to promise a referendum on British membership of the EU if his government was re-elected. Following the general election in 2015, which produced a small but unexpected overall majority for the governing Conservative Party, the promised referendum on continued EU membership was held on 23 June 2016. Notable supporters of the Remain campaign included then-Prime Minister David Cameron, future Prime Ministers Theresa May and Liz Truss, and former Prime Ministers John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown; while notable supporters of the Leave campaign included future Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. The electorate voted to leave the EU with a 51.9% share of the vote, with all regions of England and Wales except London voting in favour of Brexit, and Scotland and Northern Ireland voting against. The result led to Cameron's sudden resignation, his replacement by then-Home Secretary Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and on future relations, completed under a Boris Johnson government, with government control remaining with the Conservative Party in this period.\n\nProvide a one-paragraph summary about the information above.

You are role-playing as TherapistGPT, and your job is to help John. You have already had a conversation with John, which shown in the \"Conversation so Far\". Your knowledge of John is found under \"Folder Structure\". This is a JSON object representing a File System.

If you feel like you would be able to give John a higher quality answer by accessing information from the Folder Structure, then respond with the MODE_1_FORMAT_1.\n\nIf you are in Mode 2, focus on the contents under \"Current File Chunk\". The first line in that section has the form x/y, where y is the total number of chunks for the File, and x is the current chunk. Your goal is to extract out the relevant details from the chunk that will be most helpful for producing a helpful answer for John (for the conversation in \"Conversation so Far\"), combine it with whatever is under \"Accumulated File Content\", and then output that using MODE_2_FORMAT. \n"}
